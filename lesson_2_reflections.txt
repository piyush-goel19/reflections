Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we initialize a repository on a specific directory, git creates an empty repository with no files to track or commit on. It just initializes the process.
Every git repository is linked to a specific directory. All the files in that directory and the subdirectories of that directory only can be contained in that 
repository. And sometimes its possible that git contain, or can keep track of, some of the files of that directory rather than all of them.
In order to keep track of all the files in that directory along with their commit history.

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area acts as a bridge between working directory and the repository. The changes(or files) you want to commit are first added to the staging area from 
the working directory, then these files are bundled into a single commit in the repository. It helps us to commit changes according to the principle of 
"one commit per logical change".
