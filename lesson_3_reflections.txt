When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when we want to collaborate with others i.e share our work with other people and also involve them with us, so that they could also 
contribute something or the other in our work while either sitting down the hall or miles away. Thats where comes the usefulness of
github platform and the need to create remote repositories so that everyone could push thier changes to it at one place. And remote 
repository also helps us to keep our files on github and on our computer in sync.
